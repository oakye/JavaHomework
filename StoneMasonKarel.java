 * --------------------------
 * CS106A Assignment 1, Problem 2
 * 
 * Karel has been hired to repair the damage done to the Quad
 *  in the 1989 earthquake. In particular, Karel is to repair a set of arches 
 *  where some of the stones (represented by beepers, of course) are missing 
 *  from the columns supporting the arches.
 *  
 *  This program is general enough to handle any world that meets certain basic 
 *  conditions as outlined here:
 *  
 *  Karel starts at 1st Avenue and 1st Street, facing east, with an infinite number
 * of beepers in Karelâ€™s beeper bag.
 * The columns are exactly four units apart, on 1st, 5th, 9th Avenue, and so forth.
 * The end of the columns is marked by a wall immediately after the final column. 
 * This wall section appears after 13th Avenue in the example, but your program 
 * should work for any number of columns. The top of the column is marked by a 
 * wall, but Karel cannot assume that columns are always five units high, or even 
 * that all columns are the same height.
 * Some of the corners in the column may already contain beepers representing 
 * stones that are still in place. Your program should not put a second beeper 
 * on these corners.
